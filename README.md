# merge_files
merges two files together using java language

 * Written by Diana Sen
 * This program will take 2 files (one by one) from user input. 
 * These files will be read and merged into third, new file named solutions type is txt
 * they will be merged line by line meaning one line from file 1 and one line from file 2 until
 * there is no more lines with text left
 * 
 * program is not infinite because thrird, made file has specified name "solutions.txt" it would be unreasonable to keep overwriting same file
 * but if wanted to run it infinetly simple solution is to comment out or delete exit statement on line 109
